# NUVote
_NUVote was developed as the culmination of our work in the Data Structures and Algorithms course. Our primary objective was to devise an innovative system utilizing various data structures. Throughout the course, we gained a comprehensive understanding of different data structures, and this project provided us with the opportunity to practically implement our knowledge. In NUVote, we've leveraged ArrayLists and Hashmaps, effectively integrating them into our system_

# NUVote: Student Government Election Voting System

## A. General Description
  NUVote is a specialized voting platform designed explicitly for student government elections at National University-Manila. While akin to other online voting systems in managing elections, NUVote uniquely incorporates robust security measures. Its design ensures exclusive access for university students, safeguarding election integrity and addressing related issues. The system implements data structures such as hashing and arrays, with the user interface created using Canva.

## B. Project Objective
  The project aims to provide a seamless and secure administration of the electoral process within the university, with a specific emphasis on student government elections. It outlines the following key objectives:

1. ### Voter Anonymity and Privacy Protection
  Ensure the concealment of voter identity and protection of their privacy, allowing them to express preferences without fear of exposure.

2. ### Candidate Voting and Position Display
  Enable users to cast votes for desired candidates while displaying available positions and the candidates running for each position.

3. ### User-Friendly Interface
  Develop a user-friendly interface promoting easy navigation and increasing student participation in the electoral process.

4. ### Unique University-Issued Account Creation
  Utilize students' unique university-issued student numbers as the basis for account creation, restricting external access and ensuring fairness in the election process for all candidates.
