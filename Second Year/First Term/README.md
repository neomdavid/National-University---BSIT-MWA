# NUVote
NUVote was developed as the culmination of our work in the Data Structures and Algorithms course. Our primary objective was to devise an innovative system utilizing various data structures. Throughout the course, we gained a comprehensive understanding of different data structures, and this project provided us with the opportunity to practically implement our knowledge. In NUVote, we've leveraged ArrayLists and Hashmaps, effectively integrating them into our system
